How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

To understand what users want, you need to know a lot about the goals and problems that the stakeholders are trying to fix. By writing user stories, I can turn these needs into tasks that I can handle and that are focused on providing certain features. With user stories, you can tell the development team exactly what you need in a clear and simple way, making sure that the features they build meet the users' needs.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

The way I make programs is through iterative creation and constant feedback. I can make sure that the development process is flexible and open to change by using Agile methods like sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and sprint reviews. I'm going to use these Agile methods in my future work to keep the environment collaborative and create high-quality software that meets users' needs.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

In software development, being a good team member means adding to the team's goals, talking to each other honestly, and helping your coworkers. Being flexible, ready to take on different roles when needed, and always looking for ways to get better as a person and as a team are all parts of it. Collaboration and respect for each other are important for the team to be able to work well together and finish the job.
